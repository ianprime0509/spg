.Nd simple text pager
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple text pager, for reading large amounts of terminal output
in chunks.
It supports only the most basic functionality expected of a pager,
namely, paging backwards and forwards through the output.
By default, it gets its output from standard input; if
.Ar file
is provided, then it reads from that file instead.
